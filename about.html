                    <p>In the situation of COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing is the key to stop the spread of the virus. Many people might find it boring to stay at home all day, therefore, they try buying new products as a way to entertain themselves. Many people also take this as opportunity to focus on their health by working out and eating healthier, that is why many of them start to cook their own meals to have better control of their diet. Our passion for food combined with our ability of coding has inspired us to create a website called ICFoodies. This website provides various balanced recipes from different Asian cultures so people can experience food from other countries without travelling while maintaining a healthy diet. </p>

We all decided to pick this name as we all enjoy BBQ and hotpot, and Enoki mushroom is a must-have ingredient in both of these dishes. The name is also elegant and evokes an Asian vibe. Furthermore, Enoki means honest in Japanese, and we believe that honesty is one of the most vital traits in a person. As a result, we want to collaborate and offer our product to our users with complete integrity and morality in order to establish a firm foundation of trust in our partnerships. We hope to create a web application for people who appreciate Asian cuisines and wish to spice up their home-cooked meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. This way, not only will people be ensured of the quality of the food, but they will also reduce the risk of getting infected from takeout. </p>

                    <p>Our team members are all from Vietnam where we are raised with Asian cuisine. We value our meals with family as in our culture, family defines our identity and holds a significant importance in our life. Food is the key to erase the generation gap and strengthen the bond within our family. Therefore, we like to cook our own meals rather than buying food from outside.

                    There are also a lot of benefits of cooking at home according to many food blogger, it is economic, it is a good stress reliever, it can boost your creativity and help with your mental issues. Covid-19 can cause a lot of stress, fear, and anxiety as the number of death and unemployment is rising significantly. Cooking a dish can help distract us from these negative feelings since it is a form of meditate. </p>

                    <p>Our goal is to create a food website that gives you a variety of healthy Asian food recipes for you to try out. These recipes can create a balanced diet for those who are concerned about their weight. During the COVID 19 pandemic, many people had to stay at home because of social distancing. Staying indoors all day can have negative impacts on your body so some people had to workout and have a healthy diet. People can’t go outside so they either order food to their home or make the meals themselves. It’s easier to control your diet if you cook yourself and you can find the recipes on our website. We guarantee that the dishes we have on our site are good and healthy options for your diet. We even want to celebrate our culture by suggesting some of the finest Asian dishes. This website is for all of you who are searching for a balanced diet but also want to know more about Asian cuisine.</p>

                                <p>I am Hoang Quoc Bao - s3926050, and I am currently trying to reach the goal of finishing my IT bachelor degree in RMIT by 2024. Before joining RMIT, I was a high school student, participating in both the IT class of Hanoi Amsterdam Highschool and the Developer Course of FPT Aptech Vietnam. I can proudly describe myself as a more experienced individual than my peers, due to my 3-years prior training with live and real business models. Despite being able to handle and analyze business concepts, I still lack the technical skills needed to be an all-around developer that I have always wanted to be in High School. Therefore, I hope to cherish and nurture my working skills and further improve my analytical mindset to be a stand-out in Vietnam IT Industry.</p>

                                <p>My name is Nguyen Le Hang Giang, I am a second-year student at RMIT University Vietnam. Prior to this, I was in high school in Australia and had planned to go to the Chemical Engineering program in the United States because Chemistry was my favorite subject. I returned to Vietnam in 2020 for a gap year and ended up studying here due to COVID. Because there are few natural science majors at RMIT Vietnam, I chose International Business. Introduction to Information Technology and Programming are one of my general elective subjects, which are not related to Business at all. This is because I am always interested in natural sciences, and even though I normally perform better in social sciences, I want to challenge myself and try new things. Furthermore, I believe that these two general elective studies will offer me an advantage when studying my minor, Digital Marketing. Even if they do not, it is still a pleasant and educational experience for me.</p>

                                <p>My name is Nguyen Thien Co. I have sparked an interest in technology since I am always attracted to computers and numerical problems. Furthermore, at Hanoi-Amsterdam Highschool, I well performed as an Informatics student, and this reinforced my confidence and prompted me to pursue my dream as a data analyst. Therefore, I have no hesitation in choosing college major but unfortunately, because of Covid-19, there is a delay in my plan so this is my first semester at RMIT. As a first-year student, despite having a little knowledge of programming, I was still struggling to adapt to an unfamiliar environment because I used to work independently and hardly communicate with others. However, I will try my best to have memorable experience at RMIT University.</p>

                                <p>My name is Tran Lam with the student ID of s3927213. Right now, I am studying in the Bachelor of Information Technology program. I do not have much experience in IT (Information Technology) before I joined RMIT so I am going to have to work harder than I normally do. What made me interested in IT is that I have been drawn to this kind of technology before, but I have never understood it completely. So, I joined this course to figure out how devices like my phone work and have a better grasp of the Internet that we use every day. I will even be able to find a job in this field despite its competitive nature.</p>
